Trump vs. Powell: The Battle Over Inflation and Interest Rates

Welcome to the economic showdown that’s got everyone talking: President Donald Trump versus Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell. Trump’s calling Powell a “fool” for not slashing interest rates, claiming inflation’s practically nonexistent. Meanwhile, Powell’s holding the line, warning that Trump’s own tariff policies could send prices soaring. So, who’s got it right? Is inflation really under control, or are we on the brink of a price spiral? Let’s dive in and unpack this.

It’s May 2025, and the Federal Reserve just decided to keep interest rates steady at 4.25% to 4.5%. This is the third meeting in a row with no change, and Trump’s fuming. He blasted Powell on Truth Social, saying, “There’s virtually no inflation, grocery and egg prices are down, gas is way down, and tariff money is pouring into the U.S.” He’s pushing for rate cuts, calling them “jet fuel” for the economy. But Powell’s not budging. He says the economy’s in a “good place,” but there’s “heightened uncertainty” because of Trump’s tariffs. So, what’s the data saying, and who’s got the better read on inflation?

Let’s start with inflation. Trump says it’s “virtually no inflation.” Sounds nice, but the numbers tell a different story. As of March 2025, the Consumer Price Index shows inflation at 2.4% year-over-year. That’s above the Fed’s 2% target—not sky-high like the 9% we saw in 2022, but definitely not “virtually zero.” The Fed’s preferred measure, the PCE price index, is at 2.3%, also above target. Groceries? They’re up 2.4% from last year, with recent months showing small but steady increases. Eggs? Sorry, Mr. President, no major drop there either. Gas prices are down, about 10% from last year, sitting at $3.18 a gallon nationally—but that’s not $1.98, as Trump claimed.

So, Trump’s painting a rosy picture, but the data says inflation’s still a concern. It’s cooled off from the pandemic chaos, but it’s not gone. And here’s the kicker: Trump’s own policies might make it worse. He’s rolled out hefty tariffs—10% on most imports, 145% on Chinese goods, and 25% on steel and aluminum. Economists, from Goldman Sachs to the IMF, are sounding alarms. They say these tariffs could push inflation up to 2.8% by year-end, maybe higher. Why? Because tariffs make imports pricier, and businesses pass those costs to consumers. Powell himself said tariffs are already behind some recent price hikes. So, when Trump says inflation’s no big deal, he’s sidestepping the impact of his own trade war.

Now, let’s look at Powell’s side. The Fed’s job is to keep inflation around 2% while making sure the job market stays strong. Right now, unemployment’s at 4.1%, and job growth is solid—not perfect, but not a crisis either. Powell’s argument for holding rates is simple: don’t rock the boat. The economy’s growing, but tariffs are stirring up trouble. If the Fed cuts rates now, it could juice demand and make inflation worse, especially if tariffs keep pushing prices up. But if they keep rates high too long, they risk slowing the economy too much—maybe even tipping us into a recession. Goldman Sachs puts that risk at 45%; JPMorgan says 60%. Powell’s playing a high-stakes game, and he’s choosing caution over action.

That caution makes sense. The Fed’s looking at the long game. Tariffs are a wild card. Are they a one-time price spike, or will they keep inflation high for years? Nobody knows yet. Powell’s basically saying, “Let’s wait and see.” He’s also pushing back on Trump’s pressure, defending the Fed’s independence. The Fed isn’t supposed to bend to political demands—it’s supposed to do what’s best for the economy, not the White House. And right now, the data backs Powell. Inflation’s above target, tariffs are a risk, and cutting rates could light a fire under prices we don’t need.

But let’s give Trump his due. He’s not totally off-base. The economy did shrink in the first quarter of 2025, partly because businesses rushed to import goods before tariffs hit. That’s a real slowdown, and lower rates could help. Plus, other central banks—like the European Central Bank and China’s—are cutting rates to boost growth. Trump’s got a point when he says the Fed’s an outlier. And he’s right that tariff revenues are bringing in cash—potentially billions to offset price hikes or fund tax cuts. If tariffs don’t spiral out of control, maybe rate cuts could give the economy a lift without overheating it.

Here’s the problem, though: Trump’s acting like inflation’s solved, and it’s not. His tariffs are already pushing prices up—businesses are planning more hikes, and consumers are feeling the pinch. The World Trade Organization says these trade policies could slow global growth, and that’s not exactly a recipe for “no inflation.” Cutting rates now could be like pouring gas on a smoldering fire. If inflation takes off, we could end up with stagflation—high prices and a sluggish economy. Nobody wants that.

So, who’s right? I’m giving this one to Powell. The data shows inflation’s still here, and tariffs are making it trickier to tame. Trump’s claim of “virtually no inflation” doesn’t hold up, and his push for rate cuts ignores the risks he’s creating with his own policies. Powell’s not perfect—maybe the Fed’s too cautious, and maybe they’ll need to cut rates by July, like some traders are betting. But for now, holding steady is the smarter move. It’s about keeping inflation in check without choking the economy.

Let’s get critical for a second. The mainstream narrative might be hyping tariff risks to slam Trump’s policies. They love a good “sky is falling” story. But Trump’s narrative? It’s political theater. He’s deflecting blame for price hikes onto Powell while pushing a feel-good story about tariffs saving the day. Both sides are spinning, but the truth is messier. Tariffs could bring some manufacturing jobs back, but they’re also raising costs. The Fed’s independence is crucial, but it can feel stubborn when the economy’s wobbling. We’re in uncharted waters, and nobody’s got a perfect map.

What’s the takeaway? Inflation’s not dead, tariffs are shaking things up, and Powell’s playing it safe while Trump’s playing to the crowd. Keep an eye on those grocery bills and gas prices—they’ll tell you more than any press conference. And maybe the Fed and the White House could talk to each other instead of past each other. Wishful thinking, I know. Thanks for listening, and stay tuned for more dives into the stories shaping our economy.
