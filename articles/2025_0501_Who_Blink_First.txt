The U.S.-China Trade War – Who Will Blink First?

Good evening, everyone. Today, we’re diving into one of the most pressing economic battles of our time: the U.S.-China trade war. With tariffs soaring to 145% on Chinese goods entering the U.S. and 125% on American products heading to China, the stakes couldn’t be higher. At the heart of this standoff is a bold prediction from U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, who says China will make the first call to de-escalate. But could he be wrong? Experts give that a 60% chance. Let’s unpack the economic impacts, expert predictions, and who might ultimately win—or at least pick up the phone first—by the end of 2025.

Picture this: it’s May 1, 2025, and global markets are reeling. The trade war has slashed container bookings between the U.S. and China by 64%, bringing commerce to a near standstill. Bessent calls this an “embargo,” and he’s not exaggerating. Both nations are hurting, but who’s feeling the pain more? Let’s start with the U.S.

In America, tariffs are hitting consumers hard. Inflation is projected to climb to 6.7% by mid-2025, the highest since 1981. That’s a $1,300 tax increase per household, with prices for electronics, apparel, and furniture spiking by 10 to 30%. Imagine walking into a store and seeing a $500 TV now costing $650—that’s the reality for many. The stock market’s no better. The S&P 500 is down 15% since February, wiping out $5.8 trillion in value. Small businesses, like Doug Watts’ Metalworking Group, are struggling, with import costs doubling overnight. Jobs are at risk too—up to 801,000 could vanish by year’s end, hitting retail, logistics, and manufacturing. And with a 45% chance of recession by the third quarter, the pressure’s mounting on President Trump to deliver results before the 2026 midterms.

Now, let’s cross the Pacific to China. The tariffs are biting there too, with a projected 2.4% GDP hit in 2025, potentially costing 10 million jobs in export-heavy regions like Guangdong. China’s growth, already down from 5.4% in early 2025, could slip to 4% without intervention. Stock markets in Shanghai and Hong Kong are rollercoasters, propped up by government cash but rattled by real estate slumps. Exports to the U.S., which make up 14% of China’s total, are crumbling, and global demand is sluggish, with world GDP growth at just 1.4%. Yet, China’s not defenseless. A massive 4.1 trillion yuan stimulus—3.2% of GDP—is fueling domestic demand, while trade with ASEAN, Mexico, and Belt and Road countries picks up the slack. A weaker yuan, possibly hitting 7.45 to the dollar by 2026, could keep exports competitive. But make no mistake: China’s feeling the heat.

So, who’s going to crack first? Bessent says it’ll be China, and he’s got reasons. He points to those 10 million job losses and China’s reliance on exports, which account for nearly a fifth of its economy. He calls the tariffs “unsustainable” for Chinese businesses, predicting Beijing will reach out “in the very near future” to ease the pain. There’s evidence to back him up. China’s quietly exempted some U.S. goods, like semiconductors and pharmaceuticals, signaling flexibility. Its Commerce Ministry talks of “dialogue and consultation,” and a recent white paper touts the benefits of U.S.-China trade. Goldman Sachs agrees, estimating 10 to 20 million jobs at risk, which could push China to act. Economist Zhiwei Zhang sees both sides assessing damage, but China’s export pain might force its hand. That’s a 40% chance Bessent’s right.

But here’s the twist: there’s a 60% chance he’s wrong. Why? Let’s dig in. First, China’s got a knack for playing the long game. Under Xi Jinping, Beijing’s on a “wartime footing,” with state media shouting “never yield.” Initiating talks could look like surrender, especially with the 2027 Party Congress looming. China’s autocratic system lets it absorb pain—think deflation, youth unemployment—without the electoral headaches Trump faces. And it’s not just bravado. China’s stimulus is a lifeline, and its trade diversification is paying off. The U.S. market, once a giant, now takes just 14% of China’s exports, down from 20% a decade ago. Partnerships with Vietnam, Mexico, and Belt and Road nations are filling the gap. Economists like Zong Liang and Cai Tongjuan argue China’s built for endurance, with supply chains shifting and global alliances growing. Cai even calls it a “war of attrition” China can win.

Now, flip to the U.S. The pressure’s intense. Inflation’s squeezing families, consumer confidence is at a dismal 50.8, and markets are jittery. Trump’s got to show results, or the 2026 midterms could sting. His history of deal-making—remember the 90-day tariff pause for 75 countries?—suggests he might pick up the phone to claim a win. Bessent’s own rhetoric, urging de-escalation at the IMF, hints at U.S. urgency. When he talks, markets listen, with the S&P 500 jumping 2% on April 23. Business leaders like BlackRock’s Laurence Fink warn the U.S. is destabilizing itself, while CEOs like Doug Watts beg for relief. Wendy Cutler, a former trade negotiator, predicts U.S. consumer “rumblings” will force action. That’s a 50% chance the U.S. calls first, plus a 10% chance neither side budges, totaling the 60% likelihood Bessent’s off the mark.

What do the big players say? The Peterson Institute’s Adam Posen gives China the edge, arguing its trade surplus and export options let it outlast the U.S., which risks investment and higher rates. The Economist Intelligence Unit’s Nick Marro sees China’s trade networks—like Vietnam—buying time, suggesting a U.S. move. Justin Yifu Lin, ex-World Bank economist, says U.S. consumers lose more, giving China leverage to wait. On the flip side, some investors, like Alli Huynh, bet Trump’s escalation will force China to yield, aligning with Bessent. But the consensus leans toward China enduring pain better, thanks to its surplus and control. Winning, though, is a stretch—both sides are bleeding, with a stalemate more likely, says Jack Zhang from the University of Kansas.

So, who wins by December 2025? China’s got the upper hand in a long fight, with its trillion-dollar surplus and stimulus, but “winning” means surviving, not thriving. The U.S. could score points with trade deals—Vietnam, Japan, South Korea are on board—but consumer pain limits its stamina. As for the first call, the U.S. has a 50% shot, driven by inflation, markets, and politics. China’s got a 40% chance, pushed by job losses but slowed by pride. There’s a 10% chance neither blinks, dragging the pain into 2026.

Could Bessent be wrong? That 60% chance says yes. He might overestimate China’s desperation, ignoring its stimulus and resolve. The U.S.’s consumer and political pressures—6.7% inflation, a shaky S&P 500, Trump’s midterm clock—are ticking louder. By July, Trump or Bessent might float a proposal, framing it as a chance for China to “open markets.” China could respond with more exemptions, but a public call? That’s tougher. Keep an eye on consumer data, China’s trade moves, and Trump’s tweets—or whatever he’s posting on X these days. This trade war’s a chess game, and the next move’s anyone’s guess.

Thank you for listening, and let’s hope for cooler heads—and lower tariffs—soon.
